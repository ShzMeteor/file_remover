### **Description:**

This is a console application for removing specific files from a directory.

### **Features:**

You can either 

*	compare two existing directories and remove all files that exist within the source from the destination
  
*	or import a list of file-paths from a text file and remove each file that exists in the destination directory of your choice.
  
The program can also generate a text file of all files that exist within a source directory for later use.

### **Usage:**

Simply follow the instructions on the console and navigate the program by entering the corresponding number or letter when prompted.

The program follows the file and folder structure of the source directory, so make sure the structure of your destination directory matches that of your source.
